Continue recording my learning journey in learning C#
I hope this job will come through cause I have suspended other active
projects / goals which I don't think its a good idea

Also today I got a chance to brush through python django unit tests and user authentication reason being was involved in a django project that I was not interested in but cause was readily available my friend recommended me to do it, So there some tasks are coming up and I need to go through python to re-dust

so lets start with C#

I did enum and structure types (struct type)
enum = is a special data type that allows programmers to provide names for a set of integral integers
By default each enum value is a assigned an integer value, starting from zero.
Bytes data type holds value that ranges between 0 to 255

examples:
enum DaysOfWeek
{
    sun, mon, tue, wed, thur, fri, Sat
}
initialize the value
DaysOfWeek myDays = DaysOfWeek.mon

Console.WriteLine(myDay) // mon

enum DaysOfWeekTwo
{
    Sun = 5, Mon = 10, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat
}

the integer values for Tues = 11, 12, 13 going on

You can also change the default type of enums to any other data type

enum DaysOfWeekFour : byte
{
    sun = 10, mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat
}

struct - are similar to a class in many aspects, like classes, they contain elements like properties, constructors, methods and fields and allows you to group related members int a single package so that you can manipulate them as a group
Struct does not support inheritance, but it can implement an interface

Struct are value types while classes are value types and classes are reference types
